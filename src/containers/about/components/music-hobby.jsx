    <div>I am an absolute music enthusiast.</div>
    <br />
    <div>
      I spend more money on going to festivals and gigs than I care to admit and
      can often be found at Manchester&apos;s many small music venues in the
      evenings.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>As well as watching live music I also dabble in making music.</div>
    <br />
    <div>
      An avid guitar player since school, I have been in and out of bands since.
      More recently I have picked up home recording as a hobby.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>It is definitely a skill I am yet to master...</div>
    <br />
    <div>Would you like to know anything about my hobbies? Y/N</div>
  </div>
