      After university I started my career on a graduate scheme at a software
      consultancy in Newcastle-Upon-Type called Scott Logic.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      I worked here for 2 and a half years mostly on a dashboard/order placing
      application for energy traders.

      It was great experience and I learnt so much so quickly whilst working
      here.
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>
      I can confirm to anyone thinking of working here that it gets my seal of
      approval!
    </div>
    <br />
    <div>Would you like to know anything else about my experience? Y/N</div>
